 =The License=


Kakawana is free software. That means you can do almost anything with it.
If you want the legal explanation of what that mean, you can see it [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html here] but this page is to explain
why Kakawana exists and why it is free software, and how you can help, if you liked it.

The short version is: I (the author) use a lot of *other* free software. I have made a living using it for over 15 years! So, whenever I write a program, I release it as free software too.

On one hand, this gives me lots of satisfactions, from seing my programs used around the world to being invited to speak at conferences, to having fun coding them! OTOH, what it doesn't give me is any money ;-)

Indeed I have a day job (which I love) as one of the owners of [http://netmanagers.com.ar Net Managers] a system integration/consulting/programming firm in Argentina.

If you need Linux expertise, or python development, for example, we are good, and cheap! If you bring business, that helps me.

OTOH, if you feel Kakawana is good, maybe you will want to express your appreciation in a more direct way: send me some money! There is a link when Kakawana starts, bright yellow, that says "Donations". Click it, and you can use Paypal to send me as much or as little as you want.

I promise to have fun spending it! But don't worry, it's not mandatory! Kakawana is, after all, free software, so you can use it and enjoy it, and even sending me an email saying what you thought about it is enough reward.

So, enjoy!
